Despite: 
phpoffice/phpexcel is now depricated and all should migrate to
[PhpSpreadsheet](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PhpSpreadsheet), or another alternative.

I updated it to php7.4 for depricated codes in rendering and now can be used again as it is
same namespaces, same code style. 
same usage in maatwebsite/excel v 2.1 WoooooW!
